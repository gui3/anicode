To access gui3/anicode, just follow the white rabbit :

🐰🐰 https://gui3.github.io/anicode/ 🐰🐰

gui3/anicode is just a little website
on which you can search 
[the unicode official character database (UCD)](https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/UnicodeData.txt)
using keywords to find specific unicode characters.

If you want to know more about **unicode** in general,
here's a [worthy lecture about unicode by Dmitri Pavlutin (on his blog)](https://dmitripavlutin.com/what-every-javascript-developer-should-know-about-unicode/)

There is already at least one project
with the same name as the present project ([igalic/anicode](https://github.com/igalic/anicode))

The present project (gui3/anicode)
is just a little web page **made for fun
and for the sake of learning**,
with no intent on cutting anyone's grass under one's feet.

I doubt there will be any problem about such a little project,
but in any case of complains, please contact me.
